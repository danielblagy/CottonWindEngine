# CottonWindEngine
## C++ SDL2 OpenGL Header-Only Game Engine/Framework

CottonWind will be a header-only cross-platform game engine/framework.

A client project will only be required to include SDL2 & cottonwind header files to be able to use CottonWind.

A client project will be presented with choice of using either standard SDL2 rendering (for simple 2D games)
or modern OpenGL rendering (for both 2D & 3D games).
